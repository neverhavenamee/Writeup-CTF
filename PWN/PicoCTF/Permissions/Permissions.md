- We find out that we have root access to the vi/vim text editor. We can use the Vim privilege escalation technique to get root access and access the flag file in the root directory.
- Open vim as sudo: sudo vi
- Now that we are running Vim as root, and we can run command mode inside Vim by using :!sh and then pressing enter.
