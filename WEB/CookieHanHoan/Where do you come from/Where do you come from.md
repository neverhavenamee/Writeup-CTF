â€”> the red phrase refer to the server will check the header Reference

- SOOO, we just add header Reference: with value: [http://cookiearena.com](http://cookiearena.com) and send it.

- Instead of using burpsuite we can use curl

```php
curl -H "Referer: http://cookiearena.com/" http://103.97.125.56:30600/
```
